# Database Configuration (For Worker Internal Logic if needed, or leave empty if using DynamicDataSource only)
# Worker mainly uses DynamicDataSource for Source/Target, but might need its own DB if it tracks state locally.
# Based on current logic, it only reports status to Controller.
# So we might not need primary datasource, BUT MigrationExecutor uses DynamicDataSource which might need initial config.
# Actually MigrationExecutor uses DynamicDataSource which creates connections on the fly.
# But if we use Spring Data JPA or similar, we need this. For now, we use JDBC templates or raw JDBC.
